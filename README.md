Absolutely! Here's a clean, beginner-friendly `README.md` file you can include with the script:

# 🧾 Zepto Pincode Serviceability Checker

This script automates checking whether specific pincodes are serviceable by **Zepto** (India-based grocery delivery app), using **Selenium** and **ChromeDriver**. It's designed to scale across platforms — Blinkit, Instamart, BigBasket, Flipkart Minutes, and Amazon Fresh — with future updates.

---

## 📦 What It Does

* ✅ Reads a list of **pincodes** from a CSV file (`pincodes.csv`)
* ✅ Skips invalid pincodes (non-6-digit or malformed)
* ✅ Opens [ZeptoNow.com](https://www.zeptonow.com) in a browser
* ✅ Enters each valid pincode and captures whether the area is **serviceable**
* ✅ Saves:

  * A consolidated CSV report with serviceability status (`pincode_serviceability.csv`)
  * A separate list of invalid pincodes (`invalid_pincodes.csv`)

---

## 🧰 Requirements

You’ll need **Python 3**, **Google Chrome**, and the following Python packages:

### 1. Install Python packages

```bash
pip install selenium
```

### 2. Install ChromeDriver

Ensure **ChromeDriver** matches your installed version of Chrome:

* Check your Chrome version:
  `chrome://settings/help`

* Download matching ChromeDriver:
  [https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/)

* Place the `chromedriver` in your system path or same folder as this script

## 📂 Input & Output Files

### ✅ Input: `pincodes.csv`

CSV file **with a `pincode` column**:

```csv
pincode
560001
110011
999999
...
```

### 📤 Output: `pincode_serviceability.csv`

CSV with results from Zepto (and placeholders for other platforms):

```csv
pincode,address,zepto,blinkit,instamart,bigbasket,flipkart,amazon
560001,"Shanthala Nagar, Bengaluru",Serviceable,,,,,
999999,"Bhavnagar Para, Bhavnagar",Not Serviceable,,,,,
...
```

### ⚠️ Output: `invalid_pincodes.csv`

CSV listing invalid or skipped pincodes (e.g., too short, too long, not numeric):

```csv
pincode
5600301
abcd12
...
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Add your pincodes to `pincodes.csv`

Make sure there is a `pincode` column. Example:

```csv
pincode
560001
682306
999999
```

### 2. Run the script

```bash
python3 pincode_serviceability_check.py
```

Chrome will open automatically and begin checking each pincode.

---

## 📌 Notes

* The script waits \~2 seconds between each pincode to reduce load and avoid rate limits.
* If Zepto layout changes, selector updates may be needed.
* This version only implements **Zepto**; other platforms can be added by extending the result dictionary.

---

## 📥 Next Steps

Want to check more platforms?

You're set up to expand this file to also check:

* Blinkit
* Instamart
* BigBasket
* Amazon Fresh
* Flipkart Minutes

Add functions like `check_blinkit_pincode_serviceability()` and update each row accordingly.
